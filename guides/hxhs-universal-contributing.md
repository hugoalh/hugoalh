### Create Pull Request

- Before create pull request, check whether any similar pull requests are already exist, even the closed pull requests.
- Always create pull request to the default branch (mostly named `main` or `master`) of the project's repository.
- Try to avoid merge conflicts if possible.
- Try to avoid pull request with too many changes if possible.
  - A large pull request not only stretches the review time, but also makes it much harder to spot issues.
  - It is better to split the pull request to multiple smaller ones.
- If the pull request is resolving issues, link those issues in the pull request.
- If the pull request is not ready but want to save/stage it, mark it as draft and no need to add any identifications to the title (e.g.: `[WIP] XXXXXXXX`).

> [!NOTE]
> - The pull request does not need to pass any automatic reviews, automatic reviews are the references for the code reviewers.
> - For the general process time, please visit the "[hxhS (hugoalh & hugoalh Studio) Universal General Process Time](https://github.com/hugoalh/hugoalh/blob/main/guides/hxhs-universal-general-process-time.md)".
