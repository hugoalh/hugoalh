Please visit the "[hugoalh Universal Coding Guide](https://github.com/hugoalh/hugoalh/blob/main/guides/universal-coding.md)" for the details.

### Create Discussion

- Any report or request should [create issue](#create-issue) instead.
- Before create discussion, check whether any similar discussions are already exist.
- Create discussion under the most appropriate/suitable category.

> [!NOTE]
> - Some of the project's repository does not provide discussion system, please [create issue](#create-issue) instead.

### Create Issue

- Any question should [create discussion](#create-discussion) instead.
- Any security vulnerability report should [create security vulnerability report](#create-security-vulnerability-report) instead.
- Before create issue, check whether any similar issues are already exist, even the closed issues.
- Create issue under the most appropriate/suitable category.

> [!NOTE]
> - For the general process time, please visit the "[hugoalh Universal General Process Time](https://github.com/hugoalh/hugoalh/blob/main/guides/universal-general-process-time.md)".

### Create Pull Request

- Before create pull request, check whether any similar pull requests are already exist, even the closed pull requests.
- Always create pull request to the default branch (mostly named `main` or `master`).
- Try to avoid merge conflicts if possible.
- Try to avoid pull request with too many changes if possible.
  - A large pull request not only stretches the review time, but also makes it much harder to spot issues.
  - It is better to split the pull request to multiple smaller ones.
- If the pull request is resolving issues, link those issues in the pull request.
- If the pull request is not ready but want to save/stage it, mark it as draft and no need to add any identifications to the title (e.g.: `[WIP] XXXXXXXX`).

> [!NOTE]
> - The pull request does not need to pass any automatic reviews, automatic reviews are the references for the code reviewers.
> - For the general process time, please visit the "[hugoalh Universal General Process Time](https://github.com/hugoalh/hugoalh/blob/main/guides/universal-general-process-time.md)".

### Create Security Vulnerability Report

To report security vulnerabilities via GitHub, visit the "[GitHub Docs - Privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)" for the details and steps.

To report security vulnerabilities via other methods/ways, these are not available currently.

> [!CAUTION]
> - Never report security vulnerabilities publicly, any public security vulnerability report will be rejected and deleted without notice.

> [!NOTE]
> - If the project's GitHub repository have not enabled the Security Advisories system (mostly cause by misconfiguration), please [create issue](#create-issue) to request enable it.
> - For the general process time, please visit the "[hugoalh Universal General Process Time](https://github.com/hugoalh/hugoalh/blob/main/guides/universal-general-process-time.md)".
