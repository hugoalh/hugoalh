> [!NOTE]
> For the general process time, please visit the "[hxhS (hugoalh & hugoalh Studio) Universal General Process Time - Issue](https://github.com/hugoalh/hugoalh/blob/main/universal-guide/general-process-time.md#issue)".

### Create A Pull Request

- Before create a pull request, check whether any similar pull requests are already exist, even the closed pull requests.
- Always create a pull request to the default branch (mostly named `main` or `master`) of the project.
- Try to avoid merge conflicts if possible.
- Try to avoid a pull request with too many changes if possible.
  - A large pull request not only stretches the review time, but also makes it much harder to spot issues.
  - It is better to split the pull request to multiple smaller ones.
- If the pull request is resolving issues, link those issues in the pull request.
- If the pull request is not ready but want to save/stage it, mark it as draft and no need to add any identifications to the title (e.g.: `[WIP] XXXXXXXX`).

> [!NOTE]
> - The pull request does not need to pass any automatic review, automatic reviews are the references for the code reviewers.
> - For the general process time, please visit the "[hxhS (hugoalh & hugoalh Studio) Universal General Process Time - Pull Request](https://github.com/hugoalh/hugoalh/blob/main/universal-guide/general-process-time.md#pull-request)".

### Create A Security Vulnerability Report

*Please visit the "[GitHub Docs - Privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)" for the steps to create a security vulnerability report.*

> [!CAUTION]
> Never report security vulnerabilities publicly, any public security vulnerability report will be rejected and deleted without notice.

> [!NOTE]
> - If that project have not enabled the Security Advisories system (mostly cause by misconfiguration), please [create an issue](#create-an-issue) to request enable it.
> - For the general process time, please visit the "[hxhS (hugoalh & hugoalh Studio) Universal General Process Time - Security Vulnerability Report](https://github.com/hugoalh/hugoalh/blob/main/universal-guide/general-process-time.md#security-vulnerability-report)".
