## Guideline

### Coding

*Please visit the [Universal Coding Guide](https://github.com/hugoalh/hugoalh/blob/main/guide/code/main.md).*

### Create A Discussion

- Any reports or requests should [create an issue](#create-an-issue) instead.
- Before create a discussion, check whether any similar discussions are already exist.

### Create An Issue

- Any questions should [create a discussion](#create-a-discussion) instead.
- For any security vulnerability reports, please visit the Security Policy in that project, mostly located at file `SECURITY.md` or `.github/SECURITY.md`.
- Before create an issue, check whether any similar issues are already exist, even the closed issues.

### Create A Pull Request

- Before create a pull request, check whether any similar pull requests are already exist, even the closed pull requests.
- Always create a pull request to the default branch (mostly named `main` or `master`) of the project.
- Try to avoid merge conflicts if possible.
- Try to avoid a pull request with too many changes if possible.
  - A large pull request not only stretches the review time, but also makes it much harder to spot issues.
  - It is better to split the pull request to multiple smaller ones.
- If your pull request is for resolving issues, link those issues in the pull request.
- If your pull request is not ready but want to save/stage it, you can mark the pull request as draft, and no need to add any identifications to the title (e.g.: `[WIP] XXXXXXXX`).
